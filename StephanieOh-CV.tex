	I would like to apply for an \textcolor{red}{Associate position at McKinsey's Los Angeles office}. Enclosed is a copy of my CV highlighting my education and experience, including my current job as a software developer for Wolfram Research-- a computation software company and maker of Mathematica. 
		
\vspace{3mm}  
Through past experience, I have gained the presentation and analytical skills ideal for succeeding at McKinsey. Working as a Calculus teaching assistant taught me how to present technical solutions effectively. Additionally, I can apply my knowledge from the tech industry to help global clients achieve the virtualization necessary to thrive in the age of this impending global resource revolution. As reported in the \emph{McKinsey Quaterly}, a fast rate of virtualization is a key indicator of a company's competitiveness. 

%I received a bachelor's with honors from Northwestern University and a master's from Purdue University in Mathematics. Currently, I am working as a software developer for Wolfram Alpha LLC. 
%I am ready to redirect my analytical skills to producing tangible results for clients as well as my leadership skills to managing ambitious and innovative projects.
\vspace{3mm}
At Wolfram Alpha, I often work on exploratory projects prior to team assignment. I have been successful in this position due to my unique type of leadership. I identify the strengths and personalities of my coworkers and employ their skills to add depth to my projects. For example, I was successful in presenting a comprehensive prototype for a new technical education initiative in a recent meeting with the CEO of Wolfram Alpha. I recruited a few coworkers, with whom my relationship had been strictly social, to be my UX developer and domain specific expert. Together, we were able to realize my vision and create a complete prototype to move the project into the next step of development.

\vspace{3mm}
My math background from Northwestern University and Purdue University has trained me to recognize hidden relationships in seemingly disparate concepts and to devise creative solutions to any problem. While maintaining content for wolframalpha.com, I came across a strange numerical error. I identified and fixed the error and improved the speed of the program by 1000$\%$, using skills acquired during graduate school. As the content I develop goes live weekly, I am also experienced working in a result-oriented environment.

\vspace{3mm}
I have leveraged my unique education background from four different countries to develop a creative point of view and adaptability. Unlike other applicants who may have problems adjusting to the rigorous environment at McKinsey, I am ready to use my analytical intuition to thrive at the company. 

\vspace{3mm}
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing opportunities with you.
