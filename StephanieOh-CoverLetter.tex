	I would like to apply for the Software Engineer-Services position at your San Francisco office. I have attached a copy of my CV with my education and experience, including my current job as a software developer for Wolfram Research and Wolfram|Alpha. 
			
\vspace{3mm}  
	I believe there are many similarities between being a software engineer at Wolfram|Alpha and MyFitnessPal; both companies rely heavily on continuous deployment and low latency systems. The bulk of my responsibilities at Wolfram include creating math content which is automatically tested and deployed on a weekly basis and maintaining and debugging the content currently available on wolframalpha.com. I believe the agile development process would translate to MyFitnessPal. In addition, wolframalpha.com is a mass user-based system, as is MyFitnessPal, so I am constantly keeping the user experience and limitations in mind while developing content. 
	
\vspace{3mm}  
	The main reason for my interest lays in the culture of MyFitnessPal. I strongly believe in product's philosophy, I am a big believer that a small group of focused individuals is able to create a big and excellent product. In addition, I strive on human interaction and brainstorming with other engineers but my current position as a remote employee at Wolfram Research has limited this daily interaction for me. I hope to once again be working alongside motivated and brilliant people. 
	
\vspace{3mm}  
	Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to discussing opportunities with you. For whatever it's worth, I love MyFitnessPal and try to get people around me to use it at least once, because really, that is all it takes to convert someone.
